# Synth Containers

Shared Synth container and environment runtime substrate.

This package is the semver-friendly home for the shared ontology, protocols,
profiles, capability vocabulary, reference HTTP transport, and adapter
comparison surface needed to make real container consumers interoperate across:

- Go-Explore / `go_ex`
- MIPROv2
- standard eval harnesses
- pipeline RL without token traces
- pipeline RL with token ids / logprobs / logits
- Harbor / OpenEnv / Archipelago proxy adapters

## Design stance

The package stays layered on purpose:

1. semantics first
2. protocols second
3. transport third

The goal is not one flat API that erases every runtime’s meaning. The goal is a
shared substrate with explicit fidelity, checkpoint semantics, reward semantics,
and runtime/tool/proxy declarations.

## Core ontology

The deepest shared nouns are:

- `Runtime`
- `Actor`
- `Action`
- `Observation`
- `State`
- `Execution`
- `Outcome`
- `TaskInstance`

First-class surrounding nouns include:

- `Task`
- `TaskCatalog`
- `Artifact`
- `Trace`
- `Checkpoint`
- `Trajectory`
- `Tool`
- `VerifierResult`
- `AgentSession`

## Primitive protocols

The package defines and types the shared protocol vocabulary for:

- catalog-backed
- resettable
- steppable
- observable
- state-readable
- checkpointable
- restorable
- forkable
- rollout-runnable
- async-rollout-runnable
- trace-emitting
- reward-emitting
- verifier-backed
- tool-callable
- token-trace-emitting
- multi-actor
- proxied-inference-backed

## Composed profiles

Implemented profiles:

- stateless evaluator
- gym-style environment
- checkpointable stateful environment
- checkpointable long-horizon environment
- multi-agent long-horizon environment
- sandboxed MCP world
- RL trajectory emitter
- token-level RL environment
- harness-managed benchmark environment

Profiles can be inferred from declared protocol fidelity, and missing protocol
requirements can be reported explicitly.

## Canonical capability surface

The normalized capability surface includes:

- contract version
- runtime kind
- rollout modes
- statefulness tier
- noun / protocol / profile fidelity
- checkpoint semantics
- restore / resume semantics
- branching support
- true-environment-snapshot support
- artifact / trace / reward / verifier support
- tool runtime declarations
- token / logprob / logits support
- route hints for discovery and control operations

Task definitions, task instances, task info, and task catalogs can also carry
`resource_refs`. These references are intentionally neutral: framework-specific
detail belongs in `subtype` and `metadata`, while the umbrella `kind` remains
small and stable.

## Reference HTTP surface

The reference FastAPI adapter implements:

- `GET /`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /metadata`
- `GET /info`
- `GET /task_info`
- `GET /task_catalog`
- `GET /compatibility`
- `POST /rollout`
- `POST /rollouts`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}/state`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}/summary`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}/usage`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}/artifacts`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}/events`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}/trace`
- `POST /rollouts/{rollout_id}/pause`
- `POST /rollouts/{rollout_id}/terminate`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}/checkpoints`
- `POST /rollouts/{rollout_id}/checkpoints`
- `GET /rollouts/{rollout_id}/checkpoints/{checkpoint_id}`
- `GET /checkpoints`
- `GET /checkpoints/{checkpoint_id}`
- `POST /checkpoints/{checkpoint_id}/labels`
- `POST /rollouts/{rollout_id}/resume`

`GET /task_info` may receive selector query params. If a runtime implements
`task_info_for_request(query)`, the reference adapter delegates to it; otherwise
it returns the runtime's default task info.

The rollout formatter is intentionally trainer-friendly:

- `artifacts[].turns`
- `trace.event_history`
- `trace.inference.turns`
- `reward_info.outcome_reward`
- per-turn `event_rewards`
- optional token-id / logprob / top-logprob data

## Validation coverage

The package surfaces are structured to be directly verifiable for:

- profile inference and capability validation
- Go-Explore contract/recovery projection
- MIPROv2 evaluator compatibility
- RL payloads with and without token-level traces
- HTTP lifecycle operations including pause/checkpoint/resume/terminate
- framework compatibility for `Environments-old`, `OpenEnv`, `Archipelago`,
  and `Harbor`

## NLE Scout Reward

`NLEScoutRewardTracker` implements the Scout metric used by NLE: reward is the
increase in observed glyph tiles on the current `(dungeon_num, dungeon_level)`.
NLE represents unseen tiles with `nethack.GLYPH_CMAP_OFF`, so cookbook code can
construct the tracker from the NLE module and use the per-step update as the
PipelineRL reward:

```python
from nle import nethack
from synth_containers import NLEScoutRewardTracker

reward_tracker = NLEScoutRewardTracker.from_nethack_module(nethack)

previous_observation = None
for observation in rollout_observations:
    scout_update = reward_tracker.update_from_observation(
        observation,
        previous_observation=previous_observation,
    )
    reward = scout_update.reward
    previous_observation = observation
```

The default is the pure Scout discovered-tile delta. If a cookbook needs the
time-penalty behavior from the upstream NLE task, pass `penalty_mode` and
`penalty_step` when constructing the tracker.
